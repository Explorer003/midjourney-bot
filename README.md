## Installation
Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sandarutharuneth/midjourney-bot
```

Fill your Token and other dependencies at [config.json](https://github.com/sandarutharuneth/midjourney-bot/blob/master/src/config/config.json)
```json
{
    "TOKEN": "BOT TOKEN",
    "API": "YOUR REPLICATE API KEY",
    "CLIENTID": "YOUR BOT ID",
    "OWNER": ["YOUR ID"]
}
```

Get your Replicate API
- Visit [Replicate](https://replicate.com) and create an account

- Paste the Key on `config.json`

Install dependencies
```sh
npm i
```

Start the bot
```sh
node .
```

## Run
On your discord server use slash command `/imagine` to get results
Ex: `/imagine midjourney style anime landscape, genshin impact style`

## Common Errors
Usually after using the bot for docents of times, you'll get an error most likely saying `model` not found or a `prediction` error. This is because the free `API` that you're using on your app has been limited for a while. We don't know what is the exact  waiting time but you can try changing the `IP` address of the bot host.

### PS:
- Add `midjourney style` or `mdjrny-v4` key word somewhere on your promt for better results
